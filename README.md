# GitHub for Non-Programmers


### About
These workshop materials were developed as part of the [25x52](https://25x52.site) initiative. GitHub is popular among developers for managing source code...but it’s not just for programmers. In this workshop, participants will take advantage of GitHub's excellent distributed version-control capabilities and collaboration features to host and share their own open-source, non-technical projects. No programming skills required. Requires a Mac running OS X Yosemite (10.10+).

What we'll cover:
- Learn basic Git commands for navigating and managing files using terminal
- Use GitHub to create a webpage and host open-source projects for free
- Understand how Git’s version-control works
- Learn how to contribute to other projects through pull requests

Examples of non-technical GitHub projects:
- https://github.com/why-el/crowd-written-novel
- https://github.com/thoughtbot/design-sprint
- https://github.com/seriesseed/equity
- https://github.com/dianakimball/mentoring 
- https://github.com/bundestag/gesetze (site: http://bundestag.github.io/gesetze/) This Git repository contains all German federal laws and regulations
